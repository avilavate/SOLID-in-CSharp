## Usage Instructions

The `master` branch shows the *initial* code used in the course. It's the starting point. If you want to follow along, you can Fork this repository or download a ZIP with the code. There are separate tags (and branches for that matter) for each of the 5 principles that you can review or download as well. Here are links you can use to jump to these tagged versions in your browser:

- [SRP Start](https://github.com/ardalis/SolidSample/tree/SRP-START) *This should be basically the same as master but with an older README*
- [OCP Start](https://github.com/ardalis/SolidSample/tree/OCP-START)
- [LSP Start](https://github.com/ardalis/SolidSample/tree/LSP-START)
- [ISP Start](https://github.com/ardalis/SolidSample/tree/ISP-START)
- [DIP Start](https://github.com/ardalis/SolidSample/tree/DIP-START)

The sample code was written using [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.com/). You can download the free Community edition which should work fine with this code. Alternately, you can use Visual Studio Code or another editor you prefer.
